                <p>I noticed that when I was talking to friends and family not many of them were aware of the 50-30-20 rule, so I
                    decided to create this app to help them with this budgeting framework and make it easier for them by not using spreadsheets.
                    I think is important for people to know about this rule since it can have huge effects on their financials.</p>
                <p>The main goal of the project was to have a calculator to check the monthly budget and also a section with a bit of
                    explaining about why it is important.</p>
                <p>At first the design was pretty simple, with just the calculator. As I thought a bit more about a regular user
                    navigating throught app I started to add extra features that would enhance the UX like modals with tips.</p>

                <p>React is my go to JavaScript library. I like it because it allows you to work with components which combines logic
                    and UI.</p>
                <p>So what better tool to create this project than React. I also used React Router to make it a SPA.</p>
