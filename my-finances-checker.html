            <div class="project-goal__description | description">
                <p>The idea came to me after talking to friends and family. We were discussing about personal finance. When I mentioned the 50-30-20
                    budgeting method, which I learned after reading this <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/nerdwallet-budget-calculator" target="_blank">
                    <strong>article</strong></a>, I realized that many people haven't heard about it.</p>
                <p>The main goal of the project was to teach users about this method and present them with an easy tool to gauge how well their
                    monthly budget is distributed.</p>

                    <p>The project started with a quick sketch on Figma. By playing with a prototype first it was much easier to test different layouts.</p>
                    <p>The idea was to create the project as a Single Page Application (SPA). React was chosen as the main tool to build this project. A couple of React libraries were used.
                        React Router was one of them since is the de facto way to create SPAs in React. React Hook Form was also used to create the form to add incomes and expenses. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The project live version was deployed with Netlify since it has an integration with GitHub it makes deploying a breeze.</p>

            <div class="project-problems__description | description">
                <p>One of the first problems I faced was trying to learn how to use the newest version of React Router and the React Hook Form library. This required a
                    step back to do a bit of research.
                </p>
                <p>Reusing components was another challenge, since there were a few differences between them it wasn't as straightforward to set them up. After iterating on
                    a few workarounds I managed to find a way to reuse them.
                </p>
                <p>By far the largest challenge to overcome due to amount of new information was setting up the project repository up to the community standards. This also required
                    doing research.

            <h2 class="project-lessons__title | title">Lessons Learned</h2>
            <div class="project-lessons__description | description">
                <p>After working on this project I definitely learn a few things. It was really fun to learn about React Hook Form and update my React Router knowledge
                    by going through their respective documentation.
                </p>
                <p>I learned a lot about the different components that make a great GitHub repository and also about open source. One of the things I definitely won't forget 
                    any time soon was when I received my first Pull Request. Having the repository up to the community standards was key.
