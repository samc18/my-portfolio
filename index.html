            <h2 class="about-me__title">About Me</h2>
            <img class="about-me__img" src="./assets/about-me-img.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="about-me__description">Hello there! I'm Sam and love building things with code.</p>
            <p class="about-me__description">I still remember the first time my parents brought a computer to our house.
            It was a Toshiba laptop that my dad used for work. It took forever to turn on,
            so we had to schedule some time to wait for it to start.</p>
            <p class="about-me__description">Since that moment I got hooked. My favorite courses in school were computer-related ones. I even did a web page about
            Egypt as a science fair project.</p>
            <p class="about-me__description">Time passed and I got to college. Here is where things change a bit. I went for an Industrial Engineering degree. But
            same with school I always did better in classes that involved computers, but these were now about programming. As an
            industrial engineer
            computers weren't the main focus but the passion still remained</p>
            <p class="about-me__description">During my first internships, I was in charge of creating different reports.
            Some of them were easy to make others a bit more complex and time consuming.
            That's when the spark was reignated. I decide to learn a bit more about programming
            languages mainly focused on spreadsheets like VBA, M language and DAX. It not only
            made my life a lot easier but I became a better employee since I could accomplished really
            hard tasks within a relative short timeframe.</p>
            <p class="about-me__description">Since that moment I haven't stop learning, I gained experience with SQL and Python
            for data analysis purposes. Finally I made the decison to do this full time and
            not only use it as a tool.</p>
            <p class="about-me__description">Now my focus is with JavaScript and web development. I'm looking for a full time
            role where I can apply these new skills to help a company achieve their goals.</p>
